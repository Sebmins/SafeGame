# SafeGame
A short project to create a gambling style game in JavaScript using object-oriented principles in the HTML5 Canvas.

The mini-game can be played on my website: https://sebmins.github.io/InTouch/Safe.html


## Rules 
The gameplay is simplistic and rewarding. The concept of the game is that the user cannot “lose”, the game only determines how much they win. Behind the safe doors there is 3 different multipliers. When the player presses spin, the wheel will rotate and will stop at a random number. The number will indicate the box that will open and will reveal the multiplier. The player presses spin again and a second multiplier is revealed. If the two multipliers are the same the game stops and the player wins an amount equal to that value multiplied with an initial bet. If the second spin does not reveal a multiplier identical to the first one, a third and fourth spin may be needed in order to reveal two identical multipliers.
Once the game is over the dial will continue to spin after a few seconds click again and it will refresh the page to play again.
## Still to do
Add a loading bar, the initial game appears without the font or pictures rendering. If this happens just refresh and it should appear.
